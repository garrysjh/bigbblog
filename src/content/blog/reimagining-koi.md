## Introduction

Boba, pearls, tapioca, bubble tea. If you're Asian, a boba lover or Singaporean like I am, I’m sure you're most likely familiar with some - if not all of these terms. Bubble tea has had its eminence in lots of Asian cultures, from its humble early beginnings in Taiwan to now taking up half of my neighborhood shopping mall directories (I still can’t believe that the mall near my house has 5 different bubble tea stores!), one can’t deny the notability of bubble tea as a part of our “culture”, if not, a homely cozy drink to temper ourselves from the desolate afternoon heat of Singapore.

I personally grew up drinking bubble tea from 2 different bubble tea stores – namely SweetTalk and KOI. While the former has retreated itself into the confines of smaller rural neighborhoods, the latter has proliferated into almost every edge of the Singaporean experience(™). Nevertheless, like the grown adult that I am, I too have come to surmount the childhood crush of my beloved SweetTalk and moved on to my newest bubble tea relationship with KOI, and have been a loyal KOI member and customer since 2022. Even so, like a toxic partner, KOI has always had some ugly parts – namely its ordering experience.

From its conception, like most hawker stalls, KOI has always adopted a standard counter order system. At some point, KOI chose to adopt a self-ordering experience, probably for efficiency by ensuring baristas don’t have to take up orders, at the same time optimizing their profit to employee ratio. In spite of that, I generally have had a distaste for the KOI self ordering experience, stemming from unclear user ordering experiences such as their decrepit membership system to their unsightly user interfaces. Ultimately, I've always had the thought that it works, but is it good? Not really. Why though, we would have to find out.

## Surveying

Despite having these thoughts, our team had to nevertheless confirm the validity and critique the KOI self ordering experience. We decided to do so through adopting multiple research methods – the surveying of a general audience of KOI customers, along with the interviewing of an anonymous KOI ordering veteran. We chose to conduct a survey to find out the general sentiment of KOI customers as to the self ordering experience, and the interview was conducted to find out deeper details as to what a seasoned KOI customer experiences when one orders at KOI. This survey process was conducted throughout the period of 2 weeks, and what we found was rather interesting…

In general, what we found out about the KOI self ordering experience was that in general, most people didn’t know of the multiple different methods that the KOI drink could be ordered. For example, KOI currently allows for mainly 3 ordering methods – their self-ordering kiosk at their KOI outlets, which is their and recommended method of ordering, KOI mobile app order and pickup, as well as ordering directly from the KOI counter, for which they use at outlets were self-ordering kiosks don’t exist (more rural KOI outlets).

<p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Around 9 in 10 patrons ordered using the Self-Ordering Kiosk at KOI, the other 1 in 10 used the KOI app. </em></p>

Nevertheless, we chose to press on what way the self-ordering experience might be improved at KOI, and found that most people used the self-ordering kiosks (as expected!) and also found the most problems with the kiosk as compared to other forms of self order. Therefore, the natural option at that point was to do a deep dive into how to improve the KOI kiosk experience.

![9 in 11 had a good experience with the mobile app](@assets/images/reimagining-koi/9in11app.png)

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>9 in 11 respondents had a relatively good experience with the KOI mobile app!</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>1 in 4 respondents had a less than moderate (1-3 rating) experience using the self-ordering kiosk</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>1 in 5 respondents did not know that you could order without the KOI kiosk</em></p>

Therefore, digging deeper into comments about what problems were experienced by users who used the self-ordering kiosk, we managed to find comments shown below:
“I need to look through multiple categories to find the drink I want”
“i think i remembered one time i pressed “back” from the checkout page bc i wanted to order more and it cleared everything in my cart”
“Sometimes i click on the wrong sugar / ice option, when i first started using the kiosk i couldn't find the "no topping" option”
“The machine lags a lot at times.”

The comments mentioned specific problems with the user experience in the kiosk, especially with regards to the confusion involved in navigating the kiosk to find a specific drink, or to get to a certain page, and being unable to find certain components of the ordering experience.

In general, the insights derived from the survey went into detail into how the layout and the readability of the kiosk was only manageable at best, while they believed that the aesthetics, intuitiveness and navigation all needed improvement, with intuitiveness being the most sought-after improvement. Additionally, feedback from our interview confirmed the above claims, and thus we aimed to find methods and ideas to improve the aesthetics, intuitiveness and navigation of the KOI kiosk experience.

## Brainstorming

After confirming the claims by surveying and finding out the opinions of the KOI general audience, we had to go back to the drawing board to come up with plans to improve the KOI self ordering experience.

The natural progression we expected was to focus more on the self-ordering kiosk, since we felt that having the most users recognize it as the only option to order from KOI, we felt that this would have the most impact on improving the self-order experience.

First, we adopted the method of splitting the insights we derived from the research that we conducted, followed by coming up with HMWs (How might we’s), as well as finally deriving success metrics to decide if the idea is successful or not. We decided to adopt a group oriented method of brainstorming, and made use of post it notes in quick consecutive brainstorming sessions. After coming up with post it notes for ideas on chosen insights, we then honed in on ideas that were decided via a collective vote, where each person in the group chose their top 3 ideas that we would eventually solve from.

## Solutioning

Eventually, we proceeded with a prototyping system for which we iterated initial Lo-Fi (Low Fidelity) prototypes based on the ideas that we voted for. These initial prototypes came in the form of small scale drawings that could take up to a few hours to draw and create, to give us a sense of what the ideas would look like implemented, with the plans of combining all of these ideas to create a more intuitive and aesthetic design. The designs that we combined can be seen below:

We went through many different iterations of Lo-Fi prototypes, and this culminated in our first version of our Figma Med-Fi (Medium Fidelity prototype). This prototype is viewable in the below link, and we also have some screenshots of the screens below.

Naturally, after coming up with our first solution, intuition goes to test for feedback and iterate on our following design.

After we tested, we found that most feedback fell around certain aspects of our prototype, namely a need to improve clarity, a need to improve simplicity of certain screens, and a lack of design consistency. After rounds of discussions and
