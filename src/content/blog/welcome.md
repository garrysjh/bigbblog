description: An introduction post for my blog

Hi and welcome to my webpage. This page is written in Astro.js, hosted statically at the moment on Github pages and is based on satnaing's Astopaper template.

This page will be where I write things that I've learnt, am passionate about, or things that can relate to whatever is happening around the Internet.

You can drop me an email at [link](mailto:garrysjh@gmail.com) if you have any queries, issues or questions regarding my posts. In the meanwhile, I will constantly be updating this webpage with newer features, hopefully as soon as I have time as long as the features make sense!
